# How to Grow as a Software Engineers?

---

## Seniority !== Years
## Seniority === Experience

---

## Apprentice (L1)

- You are just learning to code
- Learn a little bit of every specialization area
- Need a lot of help when working on features
- Could do simple bug fixing itself

---

## Entry-Level (L2)

- Start specializing (Web, Mobile, Backend, Infrastructure, etc.)
- Can work with a little bit of autonomy
- Still needs help for medium and advanced tasks

---

## Mid-Level (L3-L4)

- Starting to become expert in specialization area
- Can work with almost complete autonomy

---

## Senior (L5-L6)

## The Manager Way 

## The Individual Contributor Way

---

## The Individual Contributor Way

---

## Keep Being a Senior Forever
_In small companies_

---

## Principal (L7-L8)

- Can mentor Senior, Mid-Level or Entry-Level
- Have enough working experience to lead projects successfully from zero
- Know how their technical decisions impact the business
- Help other be more productive working on Developer Tools
- Learn a second specialization

---

## Staff, Distinguished and Fellows

> You don't need want to be a manager, and that's fine.

> You could keep learning more specializations as you grow

> Don't try to learn everything right now

> Yet learning a little bit of other areas helps always
