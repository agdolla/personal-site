# Fault Tolerant React Apps

---

> Fault tolerance is the property that enables a system to continue operating properly

> in the event of the failure of some (one or more faults within) of its components.

---

## Error Boundaries

---

```tsx
class ErrorBoundary extends React.Component<Props, State> {
  state: State = { hasError: false };
  static getDerivedStateFromError() { return { hasError: true }; }
  componentDidCatch(error: Error) { notifySentry(error); }
  retry: () => { this.setState({ hasError: false }); }
  render(): React.ReactNode {
    if (!this.state.hasError) return this.props.children;
    return (
      <>
        <p>Something is broken :(</p>
        <button onClick={this.retry}>Try again</button>
      </>
    );
  }
}
```

---

## Where Should I Put My Error Boundaries?

---

## How Do I Know What Is the Right Amount of Boundaries?

---

### Not Enough Error Boundaries
### Too Many Error Boundaries
### The Right Amount

---

## Not Enough Error Boundaries

---

```tsx
import App from "./app";
import ErrorBoundary from "./error-boundary";

ReactDOM.render(
  <ErrorBoundary>
    <App />
  </ErrorBoundary>,
  document.getElementById("root")
);
```

---

> Fault tolerance is the property that enables a system to **continue operating properly**

> in the event of the failure of some (one or more faults within) of its components.

---

## Too Many Error Boundaries

---

```tsx
function CheckoutForm(props: Props): JSX.Element {
  return (
    <form>
      <CartDescription items={props.items} />
      <CreditCardInput />
      <CheckoutButton cartId={props.id} />
    </form>
  );
}
```

---

```tsx
<ErrorBoundary>
  <CartDescription items={props.items} />
</ErrorBoundary>
<ErrorBoundary>
  <CreditCardInput />
</ErrorBoundary>
<ErrorBoundary>
  <CheckoutButton cartId={props.id} />
</ErrorBoundary>
```

---

### Half-Broken UI is Full-Broken UX

#### What if...

- they didn’t finish entering their credit card info?
- they did enter the credit card before `CreditCardInput` crashed was that state retained?
- What happens when they try to checkout?

---

### Generic Error Boundary, Generic Fallback 

---

#### Performance Penalty

---

## The Right Amount of Error Boundaries

---

> Identify the feature boundaries in your application

> and put your error boundaries there

---

### Finding Features in GitHub

---

### Recursively Finding Features

---

## Testing your Fault Tolerance

```tsx
function CreditCardInput(props: Props): JSX.Element {
  // What happens if I messed up here? Let's find out!
  throw new Error("Random error that could probably fail!")
  return <input className="credit-card" />
}
```

---

### Chaos Engineering

> Make components fail randomly and unexpectedly, in development.

```sh
$ yarn add react-chaos
```

```tsx
import withChaos from 'react-chaos';
// ...
export default withChaos(CheckoutForm);
```

---

## Lessons Learned

- Avoid having a single error boundary at the top.

- Don’t overuse error boundaries either.

- Identify the feature boundaries in your app and put your error boundaries there.

- Recursively ask yourself “if this component crashes, should its siblings also crash?”.

- Intentionally design your app for error states. 

- Go break things on purpose to see what happens.
